# Trivia Game
This page contains a basic Trivia Game.

Once the user clicks the start button, they have only a certain amount of time to complete the quiz. If they do not complete it in the allotted time, the game will automatically read what answers were put in or left un-answered. The user is provided with the option of re-taking the quiz after that screen is shown.
